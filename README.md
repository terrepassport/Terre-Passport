Terre Passport
==============

We claim to be all of the same race, we have passed through terrible ages of slavery and racism,
yet there is no trust among countries. Few governments allow a person with a passport from a limited set of
other countries to live in their country. And that is only for those lucky enough to have been born there.

We have the UN now. We have created a global culture through the internet. It's time we have a global passport.
